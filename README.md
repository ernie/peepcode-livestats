After working through the excellent [PeepCode](http://peepcode.com)
[node.js tutorial](https://peepcode.com/products/nodejs-i), I wanted to keep
the results around, mainly since there were several changes I needed to make,
compared to the version the tutorial created. Mostly small bugfixes and an
update to use http.get instead of http.createClient.
